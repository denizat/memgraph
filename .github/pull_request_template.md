PR checklist:
- [ ] Check and update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Write E2E tests
- [ ] Compare the [benchmarking results](https://bench-graph.memgraph.com/) between the master branch and the Epic branch
- [ ] Provide the full content or a guide for the final git message
- [ ] Notify everyone downstream (platform, dx, infra, ...) if there is any breaking change and what to do about it

To keep docs changelog up to date, one more thing to do:
- [ ] Write a release note here, including added/changed clauses
- [ ] Tag someone from docs team in the comments
